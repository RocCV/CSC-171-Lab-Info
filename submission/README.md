# Assignment and Project Submission

## How to submit your eclipse project on blackboard

Let's say you have a project folder named `Test`. You can easily make the folder into zip by right clicking the folder and select `compress [folder name] `.

You can also compress the `src` folder. (either way is fine)

After that, click on the `Browse my computer` button to locate your zip file, submit your work, and you are done!

## What should I put in the README.txt

1. Your name
2. Your NetID
3. Assignment Number
4. The sentence `I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment`
5. Explain what you did for this assignment (brief)
    * Something like "Practice using scanner" or "using variables to store information" will be fine, but for future assignments, it is better to explain what you did for each question, since it will allow you to understand the materials more!
    * btw, you can also put the notes in the program itself as comments, and write "notes in the code" in the readme.

6. Anything you want to tell the TA
