# Assignment and Project Submission

## How to submit your Eclipse project on blackboard

1. Let's say you have a project folder named `Test`. You can easily make the folder into zip by right clicking the folder and select `compress [folder name] `.

We usually recommand on Eclipse project for one homework.

FIY: for other OS, please find a compressing method (there are tons online). If you still have any question, please email your TA.

You can also compress the `src` folder (either way is fine).

The difference between single `src` and the whole project folder is that `src` only contains the source code while the project folder contains all the compiled files.

2. After that, click on the `Browse my computer` button to locate your zip file, submit your work, and you are done!

## What should I put in the README.txt

1. Your name
2. Your NetID
3. Assignment Number
4. The statement `I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment`
5. Explain what you did for this assignment (brief)
    * Something like "Practice using scanner" or "using variables to store information" will be fine, but for future assignments, it is better to explain what you did for each question, since it will allow you to understand the materials more!
    * btw, you can also put the notes in the program itself as comments, and write "notes in the code" in the readme.

6. Anything you want to tell the TA

## Frequent Questions

### Update for Jan. 26

I don't understand the submission requirement:

`This file should explain anything we need to know about how to build and run your project`.

Answer:
The instruction aforementioned was a little bit ‘useless’ at the beginning. All you need to do is to state that your project is built in Eclipse IDE and which file contains the main method to run.

This requirement is important when your project is executed based on the command line or developed without an IDE. We will need to know which file to compile and which to run. Intuitively, we need to know which file among your project files contains the main method. Big JAVA projects utilize OOP, so notifying users how to build and run is curcial.

After all, do not worry about this. We will get into this content later, and it will be much easier to understand.
