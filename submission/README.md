## How to submit your eclipse project on blackboard

Let's say you have a project folder named `Test`. You can easily make the folder into zip by right clicking the folder and select `compress [folder name] `.

You can also compress the `src` folder. (either way is fine)

After that, click on the `Browse my computer` button in blackboard to locate your zip file, and you are done!
